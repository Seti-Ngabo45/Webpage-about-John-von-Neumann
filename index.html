   <p style="font-:20px;">John von Neuman was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, computer scientist, engineer and polymath. He was generally regarded as the foremost mathematician of his times and said to be the last representative of the great mathematicians. He integrated pure and applied sciences.</p>
    <p> Von Neumann made major contributions to many fields including;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mathematics,(foundations of mathmatics, functional analysis, ergodic theory, representation theory, operator algebras, geometry, topology, and numerical analysis]</li><div>
      <li>Physics,(quantum mechanics, hydrodynamics, and quantum statistical mechanics)</li>
      <li>Economics,(game theory)</li>
      <li>Computing (Von Neumann architecture, linear programming, self-replicating machines, stochastic computing), and statistics. </li>
    </ul>  
    <p>He was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics in the development of functional analysis,and a key figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of cellular automata, the universal constructor and the digital computer. Von Neumann published over 150 papers in his life: about 60 in pure mathematics, 60 in applied mathematics,20 in physics, and the remainder on special mathematical subjects or non-mathematical ones. His last work,an unfinished manuscript written while he was in the hospital, was later published in book form as, "The Computer and the Brain". His analysis of the structure of self-replication preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA. In a short list of facts about his life he submitted to the National Academy of Sciences, he wrote, "The part of my work I consider most essential is that on quantum mechanics, which developed in Göttingen in 1926, and subsequently in Berlin in 1927–1929. Also, my work on various forms of operator theory, Berlin 1930 and Princeton 1935–1939; on the ergodic theorem, Princeton, 1931–1932."</p>
